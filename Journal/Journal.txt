Note: The paradigm chosen for working was pair programming for merge conflict prevention and efficiency due to bug reduction as a result of 
consistent second eye on the code and two brains on one problem. Planning was done on whiteboards for modules and datapath planning then implemented on vivado. The following is a general
organization of the workflow in light of the pair programming fashion which will be represented by dates, rather than names. Work was conducted both in person in the Architecture Lab, or on a google meet where both members were always working in coordination. The most updated work will be at the top of the document as a reverse chronological paradigm showcasing the most recent updates first.
